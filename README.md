# Imageboard

## WHAT'S THIS?

This app is a Imageborad built in Vue.js where the user can upload his pictures to the App and will be displayed immediately after uploading. User can click on the pictures and a modal will show up to see the image resized. The user has the possibility of leaving a comment on the picture and navigate through the photos.

## WHY THIS?

I found building this App very useful as my very first component-based project to get used and comfortable working with components and passing props between parent and children. It is also very useful to learn the concept of mounting within a component.

## TECHNOLOGIES I USED

- HTML5, CSS3
- File Storing with AWS S3
- Vue.js
- Node/Express

## SET UP

To make it run just clone the repository, install all the dependencies with ```npm install``` and in your local directory in the terminal run it with ```node .```.

For security reasons you are going to need your own AWS account and create your own Bucket and pass your credentials so the uploading middleware works.
